PA 1 - FINAL: Malware Proxy
Last Update: February 21st, 2016

INTODUCTION:

I wrote my proxy in Python, the name of the script is malware_proxy.py. My proxy takes one command line argument, the port to run the server on.

To run the proxy server: python malware_proxy.py <PORT NUMBER>


TESTING FOR MALWARE:

The malware for testing that I got a positive response from was:
http://cds.s6m5m9d7.hwcdn.net/release/472_amn/lsp/orion/orion.exe

I tested it by issuing the following commands:

In one terminal:
python malware_proxy.py 12255

In another:
telnet localhost 12255
> GET http://cds.s6m5m9d7.hwcdn.net/release/472_amn/lsp/orion/orion.exe HTTP/1.0
> (enter twice)

You should get a response in the form of a simple HTML page telling the user they avoided malware. It might take a second, sometimes the team cymru website is slow.


MALWARE-FREE WEBSITES

Of course my proxy also serves up HTML pages that don't contain malware. They can be requested on one line with a GET request or a combo of a GET line and a Host line.
