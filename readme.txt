PA 1 - A: Basic Proxy
Last Update: January 31st, 2016

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

I wrote my proxy in Python, the name of the script is malware_proxy.py. My proxy takes one command line argument, the port to run the server on.

To run the proxy server: python malware_proxy.py <PORT NUMBER>

My proxy can handle absolute URI's as well as relative URI's with a Host header. The request is finalized by hitting enter twice on the client side. The client should then receive from the proxy server the content requested from the remote server.

If any of this isn't clear, feel free to e-mail me at jakepitkin@gmail.com while grading.

Thank you!
